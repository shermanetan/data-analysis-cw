This coursework analyses data from a time-of-flight neutron diffraction experiment on an aerospace aluminium alloy sample.

Time-of-flight neutron diffraction uses neutrons to measure the distance between atoms. In this technique, a white neutron beam is shone on the sample and large detectors are used to collect the neutrons that are scattered off. The beam is "white" because it contains neutrons with many different velocities and hence different wavelengths. However not all wavelengths are scattered equally: those with wavelengths closer to regular spacing of the atoms in the crystal interfere constructively and scatter much more strongly. This means we can measure the distance between the atoms in the sample by counting how many neutrons are scattered of which wavelength. This distance allows us to measure the stress in a material, to measure its thermal expansion, to determine its structure and so on.
