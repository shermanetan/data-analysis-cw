### This coursework analyses data from a time-of-flight neutron diffraction experiment on an aerospace aluminium alloy sample.

Time-of-flight neutron diffraction uses neutrons to measure the distance between atoms. In this technique, a white neutron beam is shone on the sample and large detectors are used to collect the neutrons that are scattered off. The beam is "white" because it contains neutrons with many different velocities and hence different wavelengths. However not all wavelengths are scattered equally: those with wavelengths closer to regular spacing of the atoms in the crystal interfere constructively and scatter much more strongly. This means the distance between the atoms in the sample can be measured by counting how many neutrons are scattered of which wavelength. This distance allows the measurement of the stress in a material, to measure its thermal expansion, to determine its structure and so on.

 In time of flight diffraction, neutrons with different wavelengths have different velocities, as described by the de Broglie equation:

$$p=mv=\dfrac{h}{\lambda}$$
  
where $p$ is momentum, $m$ is the mass of a neutron, $v$ its velocity and $\lambda$ its wavelength.

These velocities are not very high. For example, a neutron with a wavelength of $1\ \mathrm{nm}$ has a velocity of:

$$v=\dfrac{h}{\lambda m}=\dfrac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.0\times 10^{-9}\times 1.675 \times 10^{-27}} = 395.6 \quad \mathrm{ms^{-1}} $$

which just over the speed of sound. In a time-of-flight experiment, neutrons are sent out in pulses and then the number of scattered neutrons arrive at different times are counted. Furthermore, since time can be converted into wavelength, it can be converted into the spacing between the atoms diffracting, also called the d-spacing.
